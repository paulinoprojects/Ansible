# YAML 
- YAML is the primary configuration file format used by Ansible, and understanding YAML is essential to writing and managing Ansible playbooks and inventory files.

- YAML is a lightweight and human-readable data serialization language that is easy to learn and use. Ansible uses YAML files to define configuration data, such as server parameters, application settings, and system configurations.

- By understanding YAML, you can write clear and concise playbooks that are easy to read, modify, and maintain. You can also use YAML to define complex data structures and hierarchies, such as lists, dictionaries, and nested data structures.

In summary, understanding YAML is essential to effectively using Ansible to automate infrastructure management, application deployment, and configuration management. It is a valuable skill for anyone working in DevOps, system administration, or software development.

# YAML Components
YAML consists of three basic components:

- Indentation: YAML uses indentation to represent the structure of data. Each level of indentation indicates a new level in the data structure. Indentation must be consistent throughout the file.

- Keys and values: YAML uses key-value pairs to represent data. Keys are typically strings that represent the name of a property or attribute, while values can be strings, numbers, booleans, lists, or other data types.

- Comments: YAML supports single-line and multi-line comments. Comments are preceded by the "#" character and are ignored by the parser.
